# AES_Encryption
This Python script demonstrates a basic encryption process using the Argon2 key derivation function and the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. It generates a key, takes user input, encrypts and then decrypts the message, and logs each step with timestamps in a CSV file, providing a simple illustration of secure message handling.
