# Encryption Process

This Python script demonstrates a simple encryption process using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. It allows users to input a message, encrypt and decrypt it, and records the steps in a CSV file.

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python E&C.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to input a message.
3. The script will display the steps, including key generation, encryption, and decryption.
4. The process details are recorded in the `encryption_process.csv` file.

## Dependencies

- `cryptography`: Install using `pip install cryptography`.

## File Structure

- `encryption_process.py`: Main Python script.
- `encryption_process.csv`: CSV file recording each step of the encryption process.
